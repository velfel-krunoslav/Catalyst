  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  assets:
    - assets/icons/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #    fonts:
  #      - family: Schyler
  #        fonts:
  #          - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #          - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #            style: italic
  #      - family: Trajan Pro
  #        fonts:
  #          - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #          - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #            weight: 700
